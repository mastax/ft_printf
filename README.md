# ft_printf

A custom implementation of the printf function in C.

## Description

This project aims to replicate the functionality of the standard printf function found in the C standard library. The ft_printf function allows formatted output to be printed to the standard output (stdout) or to a file stream, similar to the behavior of the standard printf function.

## Features

- Supports the following conversion specifiers: `%c`, `%s`, `%d`, `%i`, `%u`, `%x`, `%X`, `%p`..
- Handles printing of literal `%` characters.
- Returns the number of characters printed.

### Prerequisites

- A C compiler (e.g., gcc, clang)
- Make utility
